In fall semester of 2025, I taught ENVR_753 (Programming for Environmental Applications).

This course was designed to give graduate students the tools to apply the Python programming language to their own research and work. The course covered introductory material including variable types and data structures and progressed to more advanced capabilities, such as regression analysis and optimization. A key component of the course focused on machine learning and large language model (LLM) basics to help students understand how to ethically use generative AI tools in their research and professional work. The course was heavily focused on weekly assignments meant to reinforce the lectures and highlighted basic applications in environmental science.

The course will return in fall 2026 with added material.
