I am currenty a postdoc at the [Institute for Risk Management and Insurance Innovation (IRMII)](https://irmii.unc.edu/people/) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My work involves tackling water resource challenges using approaches that blend engineering and economic principles. I'm particularly focused on assessing and managing environmental risks (e.g. drought, flood, wildfire), and translating them into financial risk mitigation tools (e.g. derivates, parametric insurance).

Piror to this, I received my PhD from the Civil & Environmental Engineering, [Center for Digital Asset Finance](https://www.difin.io/) at the University of Michigan, where I worked with [Dr. Peter Adriaens](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/adriaens-peter/). My doctoral research explores the effects of water risk on the municipal bond market and ESG factors on security pricing, such as green bonds. I enjoy combining causal inference, machine learning, and civil & environmental engineering to solve problems. 

Before my PhD, I worked in the financial industry in the Greater New York area. I also have a background in polymer materials research, which I gained during my Master's and undergraduate studies. 

My prior roles also include working as a polymer materials researcher in chemical labs during both my Master's and undergraduate studies. This experience helped shape my understanding of finance and the interplay between engineering and economics. I believe that connecting these fields is key to addressing environmental challenges.


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
